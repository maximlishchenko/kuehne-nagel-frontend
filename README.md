Shipments CRUD page:

Create an HTML Page with relevant Javascript to:

- I decided to use React instead of creating an HTML page with JavaScript because
  I haven't had much experience with React before and that was a great opportunity to try it out.

✔ - Load shipments data with AJAX from https://my.api.mockaroo.com/shipments.json?key=5e0b62d0
(Note that that link might get overloaded, so you can also use off line version renaming shipment.txt file)

- I used the shipment.txt file as the link indeed got overloaded at times.

✔ - Display data in generated table (see attachment ShipmentsTable.png as example)

✔ - Provide a button in the table to open a panel to visualize details of single row (see attachment ShipmentsDetails.png as example)

TECH:

- You can implement it with vanilla javascript

  ✔ - More points if you implement it with React

BENEFICIAL ADDITIONAL POINTS:

✔ - Use one CSS template (for example get some from here: https://www.creative-tim.com/templates/free)

- I decided to use Ant Design (antd) as it has lots of documentation and examples on the web.

✔ - Implement delete button on the table

✔ - Implement update on Details panel (field values could be changed in the UI)

✔ - Use Axios

- Use React + Redux
- Use React + Redux + Thunk middleware
